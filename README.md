# hw-story2

Tell a story in [Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/)
using one of the [Curated Datasets](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/curated-datasets).

Remember to check the various built-in Framework Libraries that may help you out,
including [CSV](https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/csv) and
[Microsoft Excel (XLSX)](https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/xlsx).
There are many others, such as [DuckDB](https://observablehq.com/framework/lib/duckdb).

You're welcome to use any of the many 
[Framework Examples](https://github.com/observablehq/framework/tree/main/examples) on github
or the [notebooks](https://observablehq.com/platform/notebooks) on observablehq.com.
Many of them use the curated datasets.
Remember to acknowledge and provide links to any of the examples that you used.
(Note that [notebooks](https://observablehq.com/documentation/notebooks/) 
use a slightly different syntax for some things than Framework.)

## In the next class...

Please be ready to use your demo to tell your story. 
Explain any challenges that you encountered and/or things that you learned 
in creating your demo.
Remember (from the 2nd week), [Before you viz, make a plan](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_data_viz_principles/before-you-viz-make-a-plan.html#audience), 
and especially think about the sections on
[3.2 Audience](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_data_viz_principles/before-you-viz-make-a-plan.html#audience)
and
[3.5 Message](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_data_viz_principles/before-you-viz-make-a-plan.html#audience).

## Detailed instructions

Follow the same general guidance as in the first homework assignment...

* Clone this github-classroom repo onto your local filesystem
* `cd` into your freshly cloned repo
* Create a Framework app
  * Run the `npx` command that appears at the top the [Observable Framework](https://observablehq.com/framework/) docs
* During the initial dialog:
  * Include the demos, if you like.
  * Do **NOT** initialize a github repo (you'll use this repo's git config instead)
  * You can use npm or yarn (but note that the yarn syntax is a bit different)
* Add a new markdown file with your story.
* When you're done, `git commit` your repo with the new framework app and `git push` back to github.
* Submit the URL for your github-classroom repo in Canvas
